## Chess.com-API-Search
Grab a users rating for Rapid, Blitz, and Bullet via the Chess.com Public API via Python.
The Chess.com API does not require an auth key.

This script will return a users rating in a neat format and also count the amount of searches you have made, which can be accessed using the command: __!prev_searches__

Following this creation, I did learn there was a Python Chess.com API Wrapper, but this is the first thing I created in Python.
